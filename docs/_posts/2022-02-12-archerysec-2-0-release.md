We have been working on our open-source project for a while and we have made tremendous growth by helping the community by solving through the ArcherySec Open-source project. Recently we have released a new version of ArcherySec and Iâ€™m going to highlight the top 5 new changes we made.

#### Policy-Based CI/CD integration

ArcherySec now has a powerful policy-based CI/CD integration of security scanners and orchestrates in your CI/CD pipeline that helps you run the security tools seamlessly. We have optimized security tools and are helping you to inject them into your pipeline stages. We have policy-based running scanners that help you create pipeline policy and stop your build based on your rule setup in ArcherySec. [Know more](https://docs.archerysec.com/docs/cicd_scans).

#### Multi-user Role-Based Accounts Admin, Analyst & Viewer

#### Test Scanners Connection

ArcherySec 2.0 provides you to test remote scanners connection through our connector module. Now users can onboard a security scanner and test the connection between ArcherySec and the scanner. [Know more](https://docs.archerysec.com/docs/connectors-basic).
