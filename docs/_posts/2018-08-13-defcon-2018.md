At DEF CON this year, we got opportunity to present Archery tool. For those who don’t know, DEF CON is one of the most widely attended security/hacker competitions in the world, hosted annually in Las Vegas. The DEF CON Demo Lab is a dedicated area for hackers to show off what they have been working on, to answer questions, and even coax attendees into giving feedback on their projects.
